Stats, history & achievements

Collapse the right‑hand sidebar into a bottom sheet: On small devices the current sidebar (Action History, Session Stats, Winning Hand Distribution, Achievements) consumes horizontal space and makes the table smaller. Hide this sidebar by default and provide a button (e.g., “Stats”) that opens a bottom sheet or modal overlay when tapped. This follows the recommendation to free space for new functionality and enlarge clickable zones

Prioritize essential information: In the mobile view, show only crucial stats (hands played, win rate, current chips) and hide detailed distributions until requested. The case study shows that cutting out user information and enlarging buttons created a lighter interface

.

Use icons with labels: Represent each stat with an intuitive icon (cards for hand history, trophy for achievements) and accompany it with a brief label. Icons should be SF Symbols when developing native iOS to integrate seamlessly with the system look.

Typography & visual hierarchy

Use dynamic type and scalable fonts: Support iOS Dynamic Type so text scales based on user accessibility settings. On the web, use rem units to ensure text scales proportionally. Avoid tiny text; keep body text at 17 pt or larger for readability on small screens

.

Establish a hierarchy through size and color: Primary actions (e.g., “Bet”) should have the highest contrast and largest size

; secondary actions (e.g., “Check”) should be slightly smaller or ghost‑style. Use bold fonts for headings and regular weight for body text.

Ensure sufficient contrast for dark modes: Provide a dark theme where card text remains legible against dark felt backgrounds. Dark mode also saves battery life on OLED displays and is highlighted as a good practice in modern app examples

Gestures & interactions

Support standard gestures: Users expect to tap to select, drag to move, flick to scroll and pinch to zoom. Avoid overriding these gestures; the HIG emphasises not to assign different actions to standard gestures

. Use custom gestures only as shortcuts and always provide an alternate method.

Place swipe gestures in accessible areas: If the app uses swipe actions (e.g., swipe to fold or reveal action history), keep the gesture area within the easy‑to‑reach zone and provide enough space (≈45 px) to prevent accidental inputs

. Allow swipes to start anywhere in the relevant card or row.

Avoid gesture conflicts: Ensure that pinch‑to‑zoom doesn’t conflict with panning around the table. Provide clear instructions if using multi‑finger gestures on iPad

.

Graphics, animations & feedback

Use subtle animations: The HIG recommends using subtle animation to communicate status or feedback without slowing users down

. Animate card dealing, chip movements and button transitions smoothly at 60 fps; avoid distracting or gratuitous effects that could hinder gameplay.

Provide haptic feedback: On iOS devices, use UIImpactFeedbackGenerator to add vibration feedback when players deal cards, place bets or receive achievements

. This makes interactions more immersive.

Optimize assets for performance: Detect device capabilities (as suggested by the case study

) and load high‑resolution textures on capable devices while providing lower‑resolution assets for older phones to maintain smooth performance.
