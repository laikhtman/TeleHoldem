Items I could not verify

Button/tap target sizing: I didn’t reach a betting decision screen before the authentication flow kicked in, so I couldn’t measure whether the Fold, Call, Raise, and slider controls were enlarged to meet the 44×44 pt guideline.

Text size and contrast improvements: Without seeing the updated decision helper, I couldn’t check whether type sizes and contrast were increased to improve legibility.

High‑contrast / accessibility modes: I didn’t see any settings for alternative themes or screen‑reader support, but the new login flow prevented a full accessibility test.

Session reset or start‑new‑hand control: It’s still unclear if users can start a new hand or session without waiting for bots to finish, because the game session didn’t fully load before authentication intervened.

Tooltips / disabled‑button explanations: Since I couldn’t play a hand, I couldn’t confirm whether bet buttons or sliders now display explanatory tooltips when disabled.

⚠️ New blocking issue

A new “Authenticating… Verifying your Telegram account” page appears after some navigation. It currently stays indefinitely and prevents further gameplay
teleholdem.replit.app
. If this is unintentional for testing, consider adding a bypass parameter in the demo or a fallback for unauthenticated users so testers can still access the game.

📌 Remaining tasks / follow‑ups

Allow testers to bypass Telegram authentication to continue QA on the game interface.

Ensure control sizes meet accessibility guidelines (≥ 44 × 44 pt tap area) and check that the slider thumb is easy to drag.

Test text contrast and high‑contrast mode, ensuring body text is ≥ 11 pt and legible.

Verify new panel toggles for stats, winning hand distribution, etc., and ensure they don’t crowd the main table.

Confirm that disabled controls provide feedback when unavailable (e.g., explaining why a betting option is greyed out).

Assess session control options to let users start a new hand or reset the game without reloading.

Once the authentication barrier is resolved, another round of testing can verify whether these remaining issues have been addressed.
